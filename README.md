Hi, I’m @vitorhugoma and now I work as data analyst 🧑‍💻.

I’m interested in ETL process and data pipelines knowledge. I'm currently looking for a data engineer jr.  job opportunity 👩‍💻. 

I've already complete some courses for this work transition. IBM Data Engineering Foundations Specialization and IBM Data Warehouse Engineer Professional Certificate are some completed courses, both on Coursera Online.

So feel comfortable to take a look on all my projects and give me feedbacks. 
You can contact me sending an e-mail for vitor_albuquerque@poli.ufrj.br .

Enjoy it! 😅
